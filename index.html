        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web developer who has always had a passion for technology and learning how things work. I have graudated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a dual Bachelor's of Sciences degree in Geology and Spanish.  I have worked all over including helping out with geochemical research in Panama and as a Social Media Manager for another company. All in all I have a strong passion for learning and aim to learn at least two new things everyday.</p>
        <p>I am always in the avid pursuit of a healthy lifestyle through lifting, running, yoga, volleyball, and maintaining a healthy diet. In my previous studies, I gained a passion for literature and would appreciate any book recommendations. My favorite for you is One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.</p>
